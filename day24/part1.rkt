;; We split the instruction list into blocks of code, where each block
;; begins with an "inp" instruction and goes up to (but excluding) the
;; next "inp" instruction. By hand analysis, we find that each block
;; of code does one of two things.
;;
;; 1. It multiplies z by a predefined constant N and then adds the
;; input, plus or minus some other predefined constant.
;;
;; 2. It conditionally divides z by the same predefined constant N, if
;; the input (plus or minus some value) is equal to a previous input.
;;
;; In order to make the number zero, we need to make sure all of the
;; conditional divisions are successful. So we identify which blocks
;; are "input" blocks and which are "output" blocks, then we pair them
;; off so that each "output" is folded into the nearest "input", then
;; we make sure the constraints for which inputs and which outputs are
;; paired match up.

;; An instruction consists of a symbol opcode and up to two arguments.
;; The left-hand argument is required and is always a symbol. The
;; right-hand argument can be either null, a number, or a symbol.
(struct instruction (opcode lhs rhs) #:transparent)

;; A summary of a section of the code. A "section" of the code
;; consists of the block beginning with an "inp" instruction and going
;; up to (but not including) the next "inp" instruction. A section is
;; summarized by its type (either the symbol 'input or 'output), an
;; amount to shift the input by, and an amount to shift the prior
;; output by.
;;
;; A section is an 'input section if it involves a "div ? 1"
;; instruction, i.e. there is no way to shift the value to a lower
;; digit count in this section. A section is an 'output section if it
;; involves a "div ? N" for some numerical constant N > 1 in it.
