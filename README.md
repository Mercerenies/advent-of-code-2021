# Advent of Code 2021

I'll be completing [Advent of Code
2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/) here. Like [last
year](https://github.com/Mercerenies/advent-of-code-2020/), I'll be
completing each of the 25 days in a different programming language.
Further, I will *not* be reusing any of the languages I used last year
during this challenge.

Obviously, spoilers abound below. If you're planning to do Advent of
Code on your own, I recommend **not** looking at any of the code in
this repository until you're satisfied with your own solution.

## 2020 Languages

The following languages will not be used in this challenge, as I used
them last year: Forth, Perl, Fennel, Bash, Tcl, Common Lisp, Java,
Factor, APL, JustBASIC, C, GDScript, Io, C#, Elixir, Javascript,
OCaml, Haskell, Coffeescript, Python, Scala, Rust, Lua, C++, Ruby.
